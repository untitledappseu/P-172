# Player Animator Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up the Player Animator with idle, walking, and shooting animations.

## Step 1: Create Animation Clips

First, create the following animation clips:
- Idle.anim: Default player idle animation
- Walking.anim: Player walking animation
- Shooting.anim: Player shooting animation

## Step 2: Create Animator Controller

1. Right-click in the Project panel
2. Select Create > Animator Controller
3. Name it "PlayerAnimator"

## Step 3: Set Up Animator Parameters

1. Open the Animator window (Window > Animation > Animator)
2. Select the PlayerAnimator controller
3. In the Parameters tab, add two Boolean parameters:
   - IsRunning: Controls walking animation
   - IsShooting: Controls shooting animation

## Step 4: Create Animation States

1. In the Animator window, right-click in the graph area
2. Create 3 states:
   - Idle: Set this as the default state
   - Walking: For moving horizontally
   - Shooting: For when the player shoots

3. Assign the corresponding animation clips to each state:
   - Idle state → Idle.anim
   - Walking state → Walking.anim
   - Shooting state → Shooting.anim

## Step 5: Set Up Transitions

Create the following transitions:

1. Idle to Walking:
   - Right-click on Idle, select "Make Transition" and click on Walking
   - In the Inspector, set the condition: IsRunning = true
   - Adjust transition settings (duration, exit time) as needed

2. Walking to Idle:
   - Right-click on Walking, select "Make Transition" and click on Idle
   - In the Inspector, set the condition: IsRunning = false
   - Adjust transition settings as needed

3. Idle to Shooting:
   - Right-click on Idle, select "Make Transition" and click on Shooting
   - In the Inspector, set the condition: IsShooting = true
   - Adjust transition settings as needed

4. Walking to Shooting:
   - Right-click on Walking, select "Make Transition" and click on Shooting
   - In the Inspector, set the condition: IsShooting = true
   - Adjust transition settings as needed

5. Shooting to Idle:
   - Right-click on Shooting, select "Make Transition" and click on Idle
   - In the Inspector, set two conditions:
     - IsShooting = false
     - IsRunning = false
   - Adjust transition settings as needed

6. Shooting to Walking:
   - Right-click on Shooting, select "Make Transition" and click on Walking
   - In the Inspector, set two conditions:
     - IsShooting = false
     - IsRunning = true
   - Adjust transition settings as needed

## Step 6: Assign to Player

1. Select your player GameObject
2. In the Inspector, make sure it has an Animator component
3. Drag the PlayerAnimator controller to the "Controller" field

## Testing

The PlayerController script automatically sets the animation parameters based on player input:
- IsRunning: Set when horizontal movement keys are pressed
- IsShooting: Set when the mouse button is clicked

You can also use the PlayerAnimationTester script to test the animations manually.
