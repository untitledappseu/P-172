    HOW TO SET UP THE AUDIO SYSTEM
    ==============================

    1. CREATE THE AUDIO MANAGER:
       - Create an empty GameObject in your scene
       - Name it "AudioManager"
       - Add the AudioManager.cs script to it

    2. CONFIGURE SOUNDS IN THE INSPECTOR:
       - With the AudioManager selected, you'll see "Sound Configuration" in the Inspector
       - Set the size of the Sound Groups list to how many different sound types you need
       - For each sound group:
         a. Set the Type (BulletShoot, BulletImpact, PlayerFootstep, etc.)
         b. Set the size of the Clips array to how many sound variations you have
         c. Drag your audio clips into the array slots
         d. Set the Volume (1.0 is normal, 3.0 is 300% louder)
         e. Set the Pitch Variation (0.1 means Â±10% pitch variation)

    3. TEST THE AUDIO:
       - Create an empty GameObject
       - Add the AudioTester.cs script to it
       - Assign a test sound clip
       - In Play mode, press T to test direct sound play
       - Press Y to test sound type play

    COMMON ISSUES:

    1. No sound plays:
       - Check if audio clips are assigned in the AudioManager
       - Check if the AudioManager is in your scene
       - Check if audio is muted in Unity
       - Look for error messages in the Console

    2. AudioManager not found errors:
       - Make sure the AudioManager GameObject is in your scene
       - Make sure it has the AudioManager.cs script attached

    3. Sound type not found errors:
       - Make sure you've configured that sound type in the AudioManager
       - Check the spelling/case of the SoundType enum
